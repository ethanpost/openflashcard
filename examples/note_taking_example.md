q: What is meant by "the essential immorality of storytelling"?
> Twain grasped, even as a child, the essential immorality of storytelling. A man telling a tale is not under oath. He may insist, indeed he must insist, that his story is true. But this does not mean that it is true, or that it needs to be. The storyteller’s audience may expect him to proclaim his veracity because that is one of the conventions of the art. But what the readers or listeners actually want from him is not verisimilitude or authenticity but entertainment and laughter. They know it. He knows it. When he says, “What I am going to tell you is strictly true,” he is merely pronouncing a formula of the genre like “Once upon a time.” A storyteller is a licensed liar, though he must never say so.
